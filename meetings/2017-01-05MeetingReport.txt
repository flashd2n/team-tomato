The basic class diagram was made. It is the basis over which the code will be written. The final code will surely differ from this structure, it's just a start. A code was generated based on the diagram. Find the diagram in documents/RearEndCollisionClassDiagram.ncp in the repository. Open with NClass.
Some points:
The game map will be two dimentional array containing the following characters:
# - inpassible field
(space) - passible field 
^ - player facing up

< - player facing left
The map generator must generate only the inpassible and passible fields
