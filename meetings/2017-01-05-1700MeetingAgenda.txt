Agenda:
1. Creating and finalizing the project architecture.
The project architecture will be discussed and a final UML diagram of the basic structure will be created. The idea is for the necessary classes and interfaces to be easily extensible so that the team member working on a specific feature will need less coordination with the other team members. 
The UML will be created with the NClass tool (http://nclass.sourceforge.net/index.html please download). 
An attempt to include gchankov via a conference call will be made as he is not in Sofia.
