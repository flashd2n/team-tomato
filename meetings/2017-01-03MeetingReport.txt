Points discussed:

1. Proper tool for creating UML class diagrams. This is needed both for creating the final software architecture and for presenting it in the end.
The tool chosen was NClass (http://nclass.sourceforge.net/index.html please download).
Advantages of the tool are:
- easy to use
- UML elements are visualized correctly and all the neccessary elements for the creating of the class diagram were available
- multiplatform (mono support for none windows users) as currently it is not clear if all of the team members have windows
- generates C# code automatically

2. A team_contacts.txt file was created with the contacts of the team members for easier communication. PLEASE FILL IN!

3. The final project architecture was scheduled for thursday, 2017-01-05-17:00 in Telerik Academy. Then the (supposedly) final UML diagram will be created with an emphasis on completeness. This will allow the team members to work more independently from each other.

Next meeting: 2017-01-05-17:00 in Telerik Academy
